## The `set` data type

The `set` is another commonly used data type in Python. 

It is a mutable data type in one sense of the word: you can add new elements in it. But, it is also immutable in one sense since you cannot change _existing_ values.

Anything between `{}` with elements separated by commas is a set. You can declare a set like this:

```python
>>> a = {1, 2, 3}
>>> a
{1, 2, 3}
```

A set can store only unique values and will get rid of any duplicates it encounters:

```python
>>> a = {1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 2}
>>> a
{1, 2, 3}
```

Notice how the repetitions of `1`, `2` and `3` were automatically removed. Contrasting this with lists or tuples, you'll notice the following:

```python
>>> a = {1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 2}
>>> a
{1, 2, 3}

>>> b = [1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 2]
>>> b
[1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 2]

>>> c = (1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 2)
>>> c
(1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 2) 
```

Notice how a set got rid of the duplicates but a list and a tuple, both retained the duplicates.

This is the essential difference between a set and a tuple: while both are immutable data types, a set will store only unique values while a tuple allows repetitions of the same value. 

This particular behavior of sets is quite useful in situations where you only want to retain unique values from a sequence (lists, tuples, strings, any sequence). 

For example, say you have a list containing information about vehicles in terms of their categories (electric, SUV, hatchback, etc.). Two or more vehicles may have the same category (a Tesla Model S and a Tesla Model 3 are both electric;  a Mahindra XUV 500 and a Mahindra Scorpio are both SUVs). In such a case, you might want to determine the unique categories that exist for your vehicles. In other words, you might want to know just how many categories are present in your data.

You can very easily do this by casting your list to a set:

```python
>>> vehicles = ['Electric', 'Hatchback', 'SUV', 'Sedan', 'Electric', 'SUV', 'Sedan', 'Hatchback']
>>> categories = set(a)
>>> categories
{'Hatchback', 'Sedan', 'Electric', 'SUV'}
```

As you can see, we got the unique categories in our data. Since a set only stores unique values, it got rid of repetitions and gave us our desired result. Looking at this, you can very conveniently say that your vehicles belong to either of these four categories: Hatchback, Sedan, Electric and SUV. Imagine if you had a million vehicles in your data. Makes your work much, much easier, doesn't it?

There are certain limitations on what a set can store in it, though. Just like the keys in case of dictionaries, **a set can only store immutable data types like strings, numbers and tuples**. Let's try storing a list, which is mutable, in a set:

```python
>>> a = {1, 2, [1, 2, 3]}
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'
```

Ignore the error message for now and just know that a set cannot store mutable data types.

### Indexing, slicing and item assignment

Another thing you need to remember about sets is that you cannot index them like lists, tuples or strings. This is really a consequence of how sets are implemented in the language and the details are beyond the scope of our sessions for now. Let's see what happens if we try to index a set:

```python
>>> a = {1, 2, 3}
>>> a[0]
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: 'set' object does not support indexing
```

The error message is quite direct and clear. You cannot index a set. Consequently, you cannot slice a set:

```python
>>> a[1:3]
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: 'set' object is not subscriptable
```

Since there isn't really any way of accessing the "insides" of a set, you obviously cannot mutate it:

```python
>>> a = {1, 2, 3}
>>> a[0] = 100
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: 'set' object does not support item assignment
```

### Length calculation

You can obtain the length of a set using `len()`:

```python
>>> a = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
>>> len(a)
8
```

### Item checking

You can check whether an item exists in the set or not using the `in` keyword:

```python
>>> a = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}
>>> 1 in a
True
>>> 10 in a
True
>>> 'z' in a
False
```

### Set operations

You all have worked with sets in mathematics. You know that you can get the union of two or more sets, the intersection of two or more sets, the "subtraction" of two or more sets, etc. Similarly, Python sets support these operations.

#### Union of Sets

There are two ways of getting the union, the first using an operator and the second using a method. 

The operator used is the _unary or_ (`|`) operator. This makes logical sense since the union of two sets, A and B, is defined as elements which are in A OR B. Why the _unary or_? Well, the other _or_ (`||`) already has a set behavior defined for any data type and it doesn't make sense to use it here in this context. Let's look at a few examples:

```python
>>> a = {1, 2, 3}
>>> b = {3, 4, 5}
>>> a | b
{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

>>> c = {5, 6, 7}
>>> a | b | c
{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
```

Rather than using `|`, you can also use the `union()` method. This method does the same as `|` but is more _explicit_, in the sense that what is happening is clearly visible:

```python
>>> a = {1, 2, 3, 4}
>>> a.union({4, 5, 6, 7})
{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
```

It gives the union of `a` with whatever is passed to the method. You can pass it as many sets as you want:

```python
>>> a = {1, 2, 3, 4}
>>> b = {4, 5, 6, 7}
>>> c = {6, 7, 8, 9}
>>> a.union(b, c)
{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
```

One thing to remember is that the method does not change the value of the set that is calling it. After executing the above lines, the value of `a` will remain unchanged: 

```python
>>> a
{1, 2, 3, 4}
```

#### `update()` method

The `update()` method can be thought of as the union, since it extends a set with elements in another sequence. It can take sets, lists, tuples, strings, any sequence. This is what you should use if you want to union two or more sets such that the calling set is changed with the result:

```python
>>> a = {1, 2, 3}
>>> a.update({2, 3, 4})  # set
>>> a
{1, 2, 3, 4}

>>> a.update('123')
>>> a
{1, 2, 3, 4, '3', '1', '2'}

>>> a.update([5, 6, 7])  # list
>>> a
{1, 2, 3, 4, '3', 5, 6, 7, '1', '2'}

>>> a.update((100, 120, 130))  # tuple
>>> a
{1, 2, 3, 4, '3', 5, 6, 7, 130, '1', '2', 100, 120}
```

You can see that the behavior is quite like a union.

#### Intersection of Sets

The intersection can be obtained by using either an operator or a method. The operator used is _unary and_ (`&`) and the method used is `intersection()`. The _unary and_ makes sense since the intersection of two sets, A and B, is defined as elements both in A AND B.

Examples:

```python
>>> a = {1, 2, 3}
>>> b = {2, 3, 4}
>>> a & b
{2, 3}

>>> c = {3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
>>> a.intersection(b, c)
{3}
```

Just like `union()`, the method does not change the value of the calling set. After executing the above lines, if we look at `a`, we see that the value is unchanged:

```python
>>> a
{1, 2, 3}
```

To change the value of the calling set, use the method `intersection_update()`. Makes sense, doesn't it? `update()` changes the value for unions, `intersection_update()` changes the value for intersections:

```python
>>> a = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
>>> b = {4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
>>> a.intersection_update(b)
>>> a
{4, 5}
```

#### Difference of Sets

The difference of two sets can be obtained using the `-` operator or the `difference()` method. The difference of two sets, A and B, is defined as the elements in A which are not in B.

Examples:

```python
>>> a = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
>>> b = {2, 3, 6, 7, 8}
>>> a - b
{1, 4, 5}

>>> a.difference(b)
{1, 4, 5}
```

Just like all other methods discussed so far, this does not change the value of the calling set. After executing the above lines, looking at `a`:

```python
>>> a
{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
```

To change the value, use the method `difference_update()`:

```python
>>> a = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
>>> b = {2, 3, 6, 7, 8}
>>> a.difference_update(b)
>>> a
{1, 4, 5}
```

Another operation is symmetric difference. It is pretty much the same. I am not discussing it here.

#### `add()` and `pop()`

The `add()` method adds an element to the set:

```python
>>> a = {1, 2, 3}
>>> a.add(5)
>>> a
{1, 2, 3, 5}
```

The `pop()` method deletes any random element from the set and returns it:

```python
>>> a = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}
>>> a.pop()  # output may differ on your machine, deleted element is random
1
>>> a
{2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}

>>> a.pop()
2
>>> a
{3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}
```

#### Subset and Superset Checking

You can check whether a set is the subset or superset of another set using the following 6 ways:

* Subset:
    - The `<=` operator
    - The `<` operator
    - The `issubset()` method

* Superset:
    - The `>=` operator
    - The `>` operator
    -  The `issuperset()` method

All of these ways return `True` or `False`, depending on whether the situation is true or false.

The `<=` operator checks whether all the elements of the _left set_ are in the _right set_, or whether both the sets are exactly equal. Similarly, the `issubset()` method checks whether the calling set is the subset of the set passed as argument. On the other hand, `<` checks whether all the elements of the left set are in the right set *without* both being equal.

Let's see some examples:

```python
>>> superset = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
>>> subset = {2, 3}

>>> subset <= superset
True
>>> subset < superset
True
>>> subset.issubset(superset)
True

>>> subset = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
>>> subset < superset
False
```

Notice how, in the last case, we got a false. This is because even though `subset` was indeed a subset of superset, both were equal.

Similar behavior is obtained for superset checking:

```python
>>> superset = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
>>> subset = {2, 3}

>>> superset >= subset
True
>>> superset > subset
True
>>> superset.issuperset(subset)
True


>>> subset = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
>>> superset > subset
False
```

Note how we got `False` in the last check. This is because though `superset` is indeed the superset of `subset`, both are equal. The `>` operator checks whether a set is the superset of another set such that the two sets are not equal.

#### `isdisjoint()`

Two or more sets are said to be disjoint when their intersection is an empty set. The `disjoint()` method checks the same, checking whether the intersection of two sets is empty or not. It returns `True` in the former and `False` in the latter cases.

Examples:

```python
>>> a = {1, 2, 3}
>>> b = {4, 5, 6}  # no common element
>>> a.isdisjoint(b)
True

>>> b = {3, 4, 5}
>>> a.isdisjoint(b)
False
```

There are a few more methods, which you can find listed [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#set-types-set-frozenset).


Sets are mostly used to obtain unique values out of data types which contain repetitions. Knowing this is very important and will help you a lot in such scenarios. So, keep set in your mind.

Alright! That's all for sets!
