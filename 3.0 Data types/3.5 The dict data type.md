## The `dict` data type

The dictionary data type is one of those data types that you'll find yourself frequently coding while programming in Python. It's essentially *a mapping of some domain values to some range values, just like a function*.

The domain values, in Python terminology, are called `keys` and the range values are called `values`. The dictionary maps these keys to the values.

You can think of it in the sense of a normal dictionary. Essentially, a dictionary contains words from a language sorted in lexicographic order. It has keys, which are the alphabets of the language ('A', 'B' and so on) and these keys have values corresponding to them, which are the words ('Apple', 'Banana' and so on). 

Python dictionaries are analogous to this. They map `keys` to `values`. They are quite similar to functions in mathematics, which map domain values to those in the co-domain.

In functions in mathematics, one domain value cannot have multiple values in the co-domain. In other words, a particular value in the domain is unique with respect to the function. Similarly, in Python dictionaries, one key cannot reappear in the declaration.

Also, in functions, two domain values can have the same value in the co-domain (like in f(x) = x^2, where 2 and -2 both map to 4). Similarly, in Python dictionaries, two different keys can have the same values.

Anything between `{}` in which elements are separated by commas (`,`) and keys and values are demarcated using colon (`:`) is a dictionary. To declare a dictionary, you do this:

```python
>>> a = {'a': [1, 2, 3], 1: 'Python', 'Python': (1, 2, 3)}
>>> b = {'a': [1, 2, 3], 'b': [1, 2, 3]}
```

Something to the left of the colon (`:`) is a key and something to the right of it is the value. Hence, for `a`, the keys are (`a`, 1, `Python`) and the values are `([1, 2, ,3], 'Python' and (1, 2, 3))`. Notice how, in the case of `b`, the values corresponding to keys, `a` and `b`, are the same: `[1, 2, 3]`. 

What happens when you write the same key more than once?

```python
>>> a = {'a': [1, 2, 3], 'a': (1, 2, 3)}
>>> a
{'a': (1, 2, 3)}
```

Python retains the right-most (key, value) pair and rejects anything before that. Therefore, the keys in a dictionary should be unique but the values associated with two or more keys need not be unique.

**Any immutable type (tuple, strings, numeric types like integers, floats) can be used as keys**. 

There are some common operations you can perform on dictionaries. Here, I list most of them.

### Alternatives to Declaring Dictionaries

Rather than writing out dictionaries using the above syntax, you can also use the `dict()` built-in function and pass it appropriate parameters to create a dictionary. 

For example, you can pass it a tuple of tuples to create a dictiomnary:

```python
>>> a = dict(((1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6)))
>>> a
{1: 2, 3: 4, 5: 6}
```

The left values in the tuples become the keys and the right values become the values. Similarly, you can use a list of lists, a tuple of lists, a list of tuples, etc. Remember that the inner sequence needs to have two elements inside it. If you pass more, you'll get an error:

```python
>>> a = dict(((1, 2, 3), (3, 4), (5, 6)))  # 3 instead of 2
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
ValueError: dictionary update sequence element #0 has length 3; 2 is required
```

You can also create a dictionary using this syntax:

```python
>>> a = dict(one=1, two=2, three=3)
>>> a
{'one': 1, 'two': 2, 'three': 3}
```

The values to the left of the `=` will become the keys of the dictionaries and that to the right will become the values.

More examples:

```python
>>> a = dict(name='Malay', python=2, IT_Club='Awesome')
>>> a
{'name': 'Malay', 'python': 2, 'IT_Club': 'Awesome'}
```

This syntax is limited to creating dictionaries which have strings as keys, but those strings can be assigned any valid Python data type value. You'll encounter string keys most commonly anyways.

### ~Indexing~ - Key Lookup

It's really not right to call this indexing since we are not actually obtaining the value at an integer index like `0` or `1`. In dictionaries, instead of obtaining the value at some index, we obtain the value at some _key_. This is called _key lookup_, since you're "looking up" a key. I am calling it indexing since it's _similar_, not the _same_, in the sense that we use the same `[]` operator.

To lookup the value at some key, you write the key in between `[]`:

```python
>>> a = {'a': 'Python', 1: [1, 2, 3]. 'abc': (1, 2, 3)}
>>> a['a']
'Python'
>>> a['Python']
[1, 2, 3]
>>> a['abc']
(1, 2, 3)
```

I am repeating that this is not the same as getting the value at some index. The implementations are _very_, very different. It just follows the same semantics.

Now, before moving forward, it becomes important to clarify that dictionaries are not sequence types: They don't, technically, support the traditional indexing that we all are aware of and neither does it support slicing as in the case of lists, tuples or strings. So, you can't do something like this:

```python
>>> a = {'a': [1, 2, 3], 'b': (1, 2, 3), 'c': 'Python'}
>>> a['a':'c']
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: unhashable type: 'slice'
```

I suggest that you ignore what the error message says for now. We'll come back to it later. 

The point here is that **always refer to dictionaries as mappings rather than sequences** since they are not sequences but mappings.

### Key Modification

Dictionaries are mutable, meaning that you can change the value associated with a key:

```python
>>> a = {'A': 'Malay', 'B': 'Python', 'C': [1, 2, 3]}
>>> a['B'] = 'Agarwal'
>>> a
{'A': 'Malay', 'B': 'Agarwal', 'C': [1, 2, 3]}
```

Again, ignore the error message. It isn't something you need to worry about now.

This can also be used to create new key entries in the dictionary:

```python
>>> a['D'] = 'FooBar'
>>> a
{'A': 'Malay', 'B': 'Python', 'C': [1, 2, 3], 'D': 'FooBar'}
```

## Item Checking

You _can_ use the `in` keyword to check if some key exists in the dictionary or not:

```python
>>> a = {'A': 'Malay', 'B': 'Python', 'C': [1, 2, 3]}
>>> 'A' in a
True
>>> 'B' in a
True
>>> 'Z' in a
False
```

It does not check for values and only keys. You'll find it useful in certain scenarios, which we will deal with later.

### Ordering in Dictionaries

If you're using a Python version below 3.6, you'll notice that dictionaries aren't ordered. This means that while you may write a dictionary in a particular order, it's not necessary that this order is maintained when you work with this dictionary. The keys can be in different positions while you iterate over them. 

For example, the following `for` loop may produce various outputs:

```python
>>> a = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
>>> for key in a:
...     print(key)
```

(I think this is quite readable and understandable, doesn't need explanation)

The possibilities are:

*
```python
'a'
'b'
'c'
```

*
```python
'b'
'c'
'a'
```

*
```python
'c'
'b'
'a'
```

And three other possibilities (3! = 6). Therefore, the dictionary isn't ordered and you shouldn't rely on the order you wrote your dictionary in while working with it.

But, from Python 3.6 and higher, dictionaries are, _indeed_, ordered. This is something new to Python 3.6. Currently, this particular feature is limited to CPython and other Python implementations do not need to implement it. From Python 3.7, this will become a compulsory feature in all Python implementations.

That means the `for` loop above will always produce this output in case of Python 3.6 (in CPython) and higher (in all implementations):

```python
'a'
'b'
'c'
```

### Length calculation

You can call `len()` on the dictionary to obtain the number of elements in the dictionary:

```python
>>> a = {'a': 'Malay', 'b': 'Agarwal', 'c': 'Python'}
>>> len(a)
3
```

### Deleting Keys Using `del`

The `del` keyword can be used to delete a key from a dictionary:

```python
>>> a = {'a': 'Malay', 'b': 'Agarwal', 'c': 'Amity', 'd': 'University'}
>>> del a['a']
>>> a
{'b': 'Agarwal', 'c': 'Amity', 'd': 'University'}
```

This particular keyword is pretty universal in Python and can be used to delete variables as well:

```python
>>> a = 1
>>> del a
>>> a
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
NameError: name 'a' is not defined

>>> a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
>>> len(a)
10
>>> del a[0]
>>> a
[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
>>> len(a)
9
```


### Dictionary methods

Like every other data type, Python provides you with some standard methods that can be applied on dictionaries. Here, I list some of them.


#### `keys()`

The `keys()` method allows you to obtain the keys of a dictionary. This, formally, is called a _view_ entity. 

Think of this: If you have a window inside your house, your window will always show the latest and current state of the landscape outside. As the landscape changes, the _view_ will change as well.

The `keys()` method is similar. **It is a dynamic view of the keys of the dictionary**. As you update the dictionary, the view will reflect the changes in the dictionary without having to reaccess it. This will be clearer with an example:

```python
>>> a = {'name': 'Ramesh', 'course': 'B.TECH-CSE', 'semester': 2, 'CGPA': 9}
>>> keys = a.keys()
>>> keys
dict_keys(['name', 'course', 'semester', 'CGPA'])
```


When we change something inside the dictionary, such a delete a key or add a new key, you'll notice the changes in `keys` as well:

```python
>>> a['club'] = 'IT Club'
>>> a
{'name': 'Ramesh', 'course': 'B.TECH-CSE', 'semester': 2, 'CGPA': 9, 'club': 'IT Club'}

>>> keys  # 'club' automatically there
dict_keys(['name', 'course', 'semester', 'CGPA', 'club'])
```

You can iterate (use it in a `for` loop, for example) over this, but not index, slice or modify it. It is simply a view, nothing else.

#### `values()`

This is the analogous method to `keys()` to obtain a view of the values in the dictionary. Similar to `keys()`, it changes with changes in the dictionary:

```python
>>> a = {'name': 'Ramesh', 'course': 'B.TECH-CSE', 'semester': 2, 'CGPA': 9}
>>> values = a.values()
dict_values(['Ramesh', 'B.TECH-CSE', 2, 9])

>>> a['club'] = 'IT Club'
>>> a
{'name': 'Ramesh', 'course': 'B.TECH-CSE', 'semester': 2, 'CGPA': 9, 'club': 'IT Club'}

>>> values  # IT Club automatically added
dict_values(['Ramesh', 'B.TECH-CSE', 2, 9, 'IT Club'])
```

Similar to `keys()`, you can iterate over this but not index, slice or modify it. It is a view and nothing else.

#### `items()`

This particular method is similar to the two methods above, and allows you to obtain the keys and values together in tuples:

```python
>>> a = {'name': 'Ramesh', 'course': 'B.TECH-CSE', 'semester': 2, 'CGPA': 9}
>>> items = a.items()
>>> items
dict_items([('name', 'Ramesh'), ('course', 'B.TECH-CSE'), ('semester', 2), ('CGPA', 9)])
```

Just as in the case of `keys()` and `values()`, any changes in the dictionary will automatically be reflected in the view:

```python
>>> a['club'] = 'IT Club'
>>> items
dict_items([('name', 'Ramesh'), ('course', 'B.TECH-CSE'), ('semester', 2), ('CGPA', 9), ('club', 'IT Club')])
```

You can iterate over it, but not index, slice or modify it. It is only a view.

#### `update()`

The `update()` method can be used to extend a dictionary and add multiple items in it at once. It can accept arguments similar to the `dict()` function mentioned above: list of lists, tuple of tuples, list of tuples, tuple of lists and another dictionary:

```python
>>> a = {1: 'one', 2: 'two'}
>>> a.update({3: 'three', 4: 'four'})  # another dictionary
>>> a
{1: 'one', 2: 'two', 3: 'three', 4: 'four'}

>>> a.update(((5, 'five'), (6, 'six')))  # tuple of tuples
>>> a
{1: 'one', 2: 'two', 3: 'three', 4: 'four', 5: 'five', 6: 'six'}
```


There are a few more methods which are not used that often. You can find them all them listed [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#mapping-types-dict).

Dictionaries are one of the most important data types in Python and are extensively used throughout the language, both in its implementation and by Python developers (called Pythonistas, by the way). I suggest that you give the data type ample time and become completely comfortable with it.

Alright! That's all for dictionaries.
