## Variables in Python

So far, we've discussed the basic data types and structures that are available in Python. You've learnt about integers, floats, lists, dictionaries, tuples, etc. It is now time to start gathering a few more building blocks which will help you (and indeed, are essential) in writing your awesome Python programs.

We will talk about how Python looks at variables.

### Variables

Let's first look at what variables mean classically. Have a look at the following C code:

```c
int main(void)
{
    int x = 10;
    char a = 'A';
    printf("x = %d\n", x);
    printf("a = %c\n", a);

    return 0;
}
```

The output of this program is:

```text
x = 10
a = A
```

I want you to look at the first two statements in the code. This is referred to as declaration and initialization. When learning the language, you all may have been asked to think about a box. The first two statements create two boxes, named `x` and `a`, and the values `10` and `A` are inside those boxes. The datatypes `int` and `char` are just a way of specifying what those boxes can store. An integer box can only store integer values and a character box can store only character values. 

Something like this:

<p align="center">
    <img src="img/variables_c.png"></img>
</p>

This analogy is very close to what actually happens in C when you create a variable and give it a value.

In Python, things are very different. The language doesn't create boxes when you create a variable and give it a value. **Instead, Python variables are really just names for the values.** Let me illustrate with an example:

```python
>>> a = 1
>>> b = 'Python'
>>> c = 1.54
```
Here, `a` is an integer, `b` is a string and `c` is a float. Classically speaking, you'd think that this code creates three boxes, `a`, `b` and `c`, and puts the values `1`, `Python` and `1.54` in them respectively. 

But, that's not what happens. Rather, Python actually creates the values `1`, `Python` and `1.54` first and then, gives them names `a`, `b` and `c`, respectively.

You can think of it as giving a tag to some item in a shopping mall or a market. An item is on a shelf. There's no name on it, making it difficult for you to refer to it. So, you decide to give it a name, say `item1`. You see another item lying around and give it a name, `item2`. That is very close to what Python is doing.

Each variable is only a name for the value that you're using. There are no boxes:

<p align="center">
    <img src="img/variable_tags_python.png"></img>
</p>

The diagram looks very similar to how **pointers** are usually represented in other programming languages, doesn't it? This is because the behavior of variables is, indeed, very similar to pointers. In Python, you can think of a variable as a pointer to the memory address which stores your value.

In other words, all Python variables are actually pointers to the values you are using. This is the reason why Python doesn't have pointers. All variables already _are_ pointers. This behavior is largely due to the fact that Python is an extremely object-oriented language. We will discuss this later, once we cover Classes and Objects.

For now, let's study the behavior in a little more details. Look at this Python code:

```python
>>> a = 1
>>> b = a
```
For someone who is unaware of the above mentioned behavior, the equivalent C code would be:

```c
int main(void)
{
    int a = 1;
    int b = a;
}
```

But, the two things are very different. In the case of C, you can illustrate the behavior as follows:

<p align="center">
    <img src="img/c_diff_behavior.png"></img>
</p>

But, this is the Python behavior:

<p align="center">
    <img src="img/python_diff_behavior.png"></img>
</p>

From the illustration, you can se how starkly different the two behaviors are. While C creates a new box called `b` and puts `1` inside it, Python doesn't do anything of the sorts. Instead, Python adds another tag to the pre-existing `1` in the memory or in other words, it makes `b` a pointer to the same `1` that `a` points to.

In C, if you change `b` by doing some operation on it, there will be no change in `a` and its value will remain as `1` since they are two completely different boxes with no relation between them.

So, does that mean that making a change to `b` in Python affects `a`? After all, `b` and `a` point to the same value, don't they? The answer might surprise you: **Only in some cases does changing the value of `b` have an effect on `a`**.

This is where immutability comes into play. You'll remember from previous sessions that Python data types can broadly be categorized as immutable - those which _cannot_ be modified - and mutable - those which _can_ be modified. **Python handles variables which point to immutable and mutable data types differently**.

### Immutability and Variables

Let's see how Python handles the types of variables differently.

#### One variable equal to another

Let's have a look at this code again:

```python
>>> a = 1
>>> b = a
```

As mentioned above, `a` and `b` both do point to the same memory address. This is true in the case of both immutable and mutable data types. Here, `1`, being an integer, is an immutable data type. You can confirm this behavior using the `id()` function, which returns the memory address that a variable points to:

```python
>>> id(a)
1473408016
>>> id(b)
1473408016

>>> a = [1, 2, 3]  # List, which is mutable
>>> b = a
>>> id(a), id(b)
(1713121652680, 1713121652680)
```

Clearly, the pair of addresses are the same in both the cases, even when `a` is a list and therefore, mutable. 

The different handling can be observed when you try to modify `b`. Let's first try it with an immutable data type:

```python
>>> a = 1
>>> b = a

>>> b = b + 1
>>> b  # New value
2
>>> a  # Value unchanged
1
```

Woah! Shouldn't `a` change to `2` as well since `a` and `b` point to the same address and therefore, reflect the same value? The answer is no. Since an integer is immutable, when you try to change the value of an existing variable to a new value, Python creates the new value in a new memory address and makes the variable point to that address.


In other words, changing `b` to `b + 1` creates `b + 1` in a new memory address and makes `b` point to that, without messing with `1` in its memory address. Therefore, `a` still points to `1` while `b` points to `2`.
This can be illustrated as follows:

<p align="center">
    <img src="img/python_imm_behave.png"></img>
</p>

You can confirm this using `id()`:

```python
>>> id(a)  # Old address value
1473408016
>>> id(b)  # New address value
1473408048
```

I want you to think about this. Why does Python do this? Why does it create a new value in the memory and changes the address `b` points to? The answer is quite simple. **Because integer is immutable. You _cannot_ change it and that means that Python cannot change it as well!** Therefore, the immutability rule won't remain consistent if changing `b` changes `a` as well. If that happens, that would make integers mutable.

This is true for all immutable types, from integers to strings and bytes.

Let's contrast this with mutable types. Look at the following code:

```python
>>> a = [1, 2, 3, 4]
>>> b = a
>>> id(a), id(b)
(1713121652680, 1713121652680)
```

The address values are the same, which is what is expected. But now, let's try to modiy `b` by adding an element, `5`, in the list and then, look at `a`:

```python
>>> b.append(5)
>>> b
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

>>> a
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

Woah! Changing `b` changed `a` as well. The reason behind this is that a list is mutable. Therefore, when you try to change the value of an existing variable to a new value, either by appending or changing the value at an index or something else, Python **does not** create a new value in a new memory address and instead, modifies it in the existing memory address.

In other words, appending `5` to `b` appends `5` to the list that `b` points to and since `a` points to the same list, the change is reflected in it as well. Even after the append, `b` and `a` both point to the same list since list is a mutable data type and hence, can be changed at its memory address. This can be illustrated as follows:

<p align="center">
    <img src="img/list_pointing_python.png"></img>
</p>

You can confirm this using `id()`:

```python
>>> id(a), id(b)
(1713121652680, 1713121652680)
```

This makes intuitive sense, too. **A list is mutable. You _can_ change it and so can Python.** If changing `b` didn't change `a`, the mutable consistency would be broken. **In a way, the behavior is something that Python is forced to do to keep its own rules consistent.**

#### Two variables with same value

Another difference in Python's handling of immutable and mutable data types can be noticed when you assign two or more variables to the same value, like this:

```python
>>> a = 1
>>> b = 1
```
When you call `id()` on this, you'll notice something weird:

```python
>>> id(a), id(b)
(94598560490272, 94598560490272)
```
The addresses are the same! This isn't what is expected. The `1` that `a` is assigned to and the `1` that `b` is assigned to should be different. To make the weirdness even more explicit, let's look at the equivalent C code:

```c
int main()
{
    int a = 1;
    int b = 1;
    return 0;
}
```

This actually does the expected. It creates two different boxes, `a` and `b`, and puts `1` and `1` in those two boxes. The two boxes are different and have no relation between them. Changing values in one box doesn't affect the other.

But, Python does the same thing as it did with this code:

```python
>>> a = 1
>>> b = a
```

This can be illustrated as follows:

<p align="center">
    <img src="img/c_vs_python.png"></img>
</p>

Why is that? Think about it. What is the nature of integer? It is immutable, meaning it cannot be changed. So, does it really matter if two variables that are equal in value don't point to different addresses in the memory? The answer is obviously no. **The `1` in the memory cannot be changed by any operation. Any operation that changes a variable that points to `1` will create a new memory address with the new value and make the variable point to this new memory address**:

```python
>>> b = b + 5
>>> b
6
>>> id(b)
94598560490432
```

Thus, the original memory address will forever contain `1`. As far as Python is concerned, the `1` that `a` points to and the `1` that `b` points to are the same thing! 


Let's look at an analogy to get a better understanding of this. Suppose you work in a company and the company has some kind of a manager. She is a person. You're an employee, so for you the manager is referred to as `Ma'am`. For the CEO of the company though, she is referred to by her first name, `Lynda`. Even though the two names are different, it doesn't really matter because they both refer to the same, constant person.

After a reshuffling in the company, you are assigned a new manager, while your previous manager continues working in the company. In that case, the person that your `Ma'am` refers to has changed, while `Lynda` still refers to your previous manager as far as the CEO is concerned.

```python
>>> maam = "manager1"
>>> lynda = "manager1"
>>> id(maam), id(lynda)  # Totally made up example
(emp_id 200 in company, emp_id 200 in company) # The 200th employee in the company will never change

>>> maam = "manager2"
>>> id(maam), id(lynda)
(emp_id 201 in company, emp_id 200 in company)  # Changing maam will simply make it refer to a new employee
```

Let's contrast this with the behavior of mutable data types. Have a look at what happens when you do this:

```python
>>> a = [1, 2, 3, 4]
>>> b = [1, 2, 3, 4]
>>> id(a), id(b)
(139990616093832, 139990616094664)
```
The addresses are different! This is indeed expected, since a list is mutable. Therefore, making `a` and `b` point to the same list doesn't make sense. The programmer most probably wants different lists with the same contents and not two variables pointing to the same list:

<p align="center">
    <img src="img/list_behavior.png"></img>
</p>

Now, when you change one list, there is no effect on the other list, and the addresses of the lists remain unchanged:

```python
>>> a[2] = 100
>>> a
[1, 2, 100, 4]
>>> b
[1, 2, 3, 4]
>>> id(a), id(b)
(139990616093832, 139990616094664)
```

<p align="center">
    <img src="img/list_change.png"></img>
</p>


Great! I hope that made sense.

### Caveats

You might be wondering why I am going so far with explaining this. The reason is that if you're unaware of the behavior, you may fall into some pits that are difficult to come out of.

Suppose you have a list and want to create a copy of that list. An unaware Python programmer may do this:

```python
>>> a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
>>> b = a
```
Now, when you look at `b`, you'll see that it has your copy:

```python
>>> b
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

Great! That gave you what you wanted, didn't it? The answer is no. What happens when you change `a`?

```python
>>> a[4] = 1000
>>> a
[1, 2, 3, 4, 1000]
>>> b
[1, 2, 3, 4, 1000]
```

`b` changed as well. This is what we have been discussing. You probably wanted to store `a` in `b` temporarily while you did some operations on `a`. There may have been a requirement to keep the initial state of the list with you. In such a case, this is an undesireable effect. You do not want `b` to change as `a` changes. But, that is exactly what happens because of the behavior discussed above. 

This can also be noticed when you try to create nested lists using the `*` operator (see 3.3 The list data type):

```python
>>> a = [[]] * 3 # List of three lists
>>> a
[[], [], []]
>>> a[0].append(2)
>>> a
[[2], [2], [2]]
```
We created a list, `a`, containing three lists. When we tried to append `2` to the first list inside `a`, the other two lists were updated as well. This is because in the operation `[[]] * 3`, the multiplication by 3 results the same list being referenced three times. Therefore, all the three lists inside `a` point to the same list in the memory. Changing one changes all others. You can try this with as many nested list structures as you like:

```python
>>> a = [[[]] * 3]  # List of list containing three lists
>>> a
[[[], [], []]]
>>> a[0][0].append(2) # Appending 2 in the first list inside the list in a
[[[2], [2], [2]]]

>>> a = [[[] * 3] * 3] # List of three lists containing a list of length 3
>>> a
[[[], [], []]]
>>> a[0][0].extend([1, 2, 3])
[[[1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3]]]

>>> a = [[[] * 3] * 3] * 3  # List of three lists containing three lists each of length 3
>>> a
[[[], [], []], [[], [], []], [[], [], []]]

>>> a[0].append(2)  # Appending '2' to first-level lists
>>> a
[[[], [], [], 2], [[], [], [], 2], [[], [], [], 2]]

>>> a[0][0].append(3) # Appending '3' to second-level lists
>>> a
[[[3], [3], [3], 2], [[3], [3], [3], 2], [[3], [3], [3], 2]]

>>> a[0][0].extend([4, 5, 6]) # Extending second-level lists
>>> a
[[[3, 4, 5, 6], [3, 4, 5, 6], [3, 4, 5, 6], 2], [[3, 4, 5, 6], [3, 4, 5, 6], [3, 4, 5, 6], 2], [[3, 4, 5, 6], [3, 4, 5, 6], [3, 4, 5, 6], 2]]
```

Clearly, you can see how complicated it can become. While finding the error is still fairly easy with a few lines of code, finding the same error in tens of thousands of lines of codes will not be easy. They are only two small lines after all. And if you decide to create nested lists using `*`, it will be even more difficult since it is only one small line.

So, how can you create safe copies of lists (and other mutable data types)? There are multiple ways:

#### Using `list()` 

`list()` is a built-in function which, when called with an argument, creates a list out of the argument. The argument can be any sequence or container type (refer to 3.1 Data Types and Structures). 

To create a copy of your list, you can pass the list to `list()`:

```python
>>> a = [1, 2, 3, 4]
>>> b = list(a)

>>> a
[1, 2, 3, 4]
>>> b
[1, 2, 3, 4]

>>> id(a), id(b)  # Different addresses
(139990585362312, 139990585459848)
```

Now, when you make changes to `a`, `b` remains unaffected:

```python
>>> a[3] = 200
>>> a
[1, 2, 3, 200]

>>> b
[1, 2, 3, 4]
```

#### Using the `copy()` method

Like `append()` and `extend()`, each list comes with a method called, `copy()` which, you guessed it, creates a copy of the list:

```python
>>> a = [1, 2, 3, 4]
>>> b = a.copy()
>>> a
[1, 2, 3, 4]
>>> b
[1, 2, 3, 4]
>>> id(a), id(b)
(139990616094664, 139990585362312)
```

You can safely makes changes to `a` without affecting `b`:

```python
>>> a[3] = 200
>>> a
[1, 2, 3, 200]

>>> b
[1, 2, 3, 4]
```

#### Using slicing

This is a slightly less recommended way of making a copy of a list, mostly because it is very implicit and goes against the Zen of Python (`import this`). 

If you all don't remember, you can slice a list, `x`, using the `x[start: stop: step]` notation.

If you don't write anything between the two square brackets except one `:`, Python actually creates a copy of the list. Therefore, you can copy a list as:

```python
>>> a = [1, 2, 3, 4]
>>> b = a[:]  # a[:] means return the whole list
>>> a
[1, 2, 3, 4]
>>> b
[1, 2, 3, 4]
>>> id(a), id(b)
(139990585459848, 139990616094664)
```

As can be seen, `a` and `b` refer to two different lists with the same content. You can makes changes to either without affecting the other:

```python
>>> a[3] = 200
>>> a
[1, 2, 3, 200]

>>> b
[1, 2, 3, 4]
```

### One last thing - Chained Assignments

This behavior remains true with chained assignments as well. For example:

```python
>>> a = b = c = d = 1
>>> a, b, c, d
(1, 1, 1, 1)
```

Here, the code is equivalent to:

```python
>>> temp = 1
>>> a = temp
>>> b = temp
>>> c = temp
>>> d = temp
```
As such, you can expect the variables to behave as they should with immutable data types.

On the other hand, let's see a mutable data type:

```python
>>> a = b = c = d = [1, 2, 3]
>>> a, b, c, d
([1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3])
```
When you change say `a`:

```python
>>> a[0] = 56
([56, 2, 3], [56, 2, 3], [56, 2, 3], [56, 2, 3])
```

All the lists change, according to the behavior discussed for mutable data types. Therefore, you should be careful when it comes to chained assignments and mutable data types. There's a high chance that you'll work more with them than with immutable data types. Thus, the probability of committing a mistake is high.

All in all, if you are clear with immutable and mutable data types, and what is expected of them, you'll find this behavior to be quite natural and straightforward.


Well, that's it! This is all you need to know about variables in Python.
