## Operators in Python

Operators are a key component for any programming language as they allow you to manipulate and mutate data in different, standardized ways. For example, we all know that the `+` operator is expected to add two or more numbers, and in certain other programming languages, to concatenate two or more sequences (strings, arrays, etc).

Python is no exception to this. It has its own standard set of operators that you can use with different kinds of data.

Just like most programming languages out there, Python has five different types of operators. They are:

* **Arithmetic Operators** - These _primarily_ deal with numbers, allowing us to add, subtract, multiply, divide and perform other operations on them. I say primarily as Python, being a high-level language, allows you to perform other operations with these operators when it comes to certain types of data. Examples include `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `**`, etc.

* **Relational Operators** - These operators are used to evaluate or more precisely, check the relation between two or more expressions (those statements which evaluate to some result) in terms of their values. For example, the `>` operator is used to evaluate the relationship of one expression being greater than the other. Other examples are `>=`, `<`, `>=`, `!=`, `==`, `is`, `is not`, etc.

* **Logical Operators** - These are operators that are used to connect one or more expressions so that they form one single logical unit. For example, you can connect two expressions using the `and` or `or` operators. The only other operator is `not`.

* **Bitwise Operators** - These are operators that work on single bits of data. We all know that deep inside, in the memory of the computer, everything that we type in Python is converted to binary `1`'s and `0`'s. Bitwise operators work on this representation of data. For example, the value of 3 in binary is `11`. A bitwise operator would manipulate each of the two bits (`1` and `1`) in this, thereby producing a new binary number and hence, a new decimal number. Examples include `>>`, `<<`, `&`, `|`, `^`, etc.

* **Assignment Operators** - These are operators that are used to give values to variables. They are very familiar to anyone with background in a programming language. Examples include `=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, etc.



While bitwise operators are indeed interesting, we won't be covering them since they fit more well with a computer science session than with a Python session. Assignment operators won't be discussed extensively since all of them are pretty familiar to you.

Let's start with the first category of operators, that is arithmetic operators.


### Arithmetic Operators

#### Overview

The arithmetic operators in Python are tabulated as follows:

| Operator  |                Primary Work                   |
|:--------: |:------------------------------------------:   |
|     +     |          Adds two or more numbers             |
|     -     |        Subtracts two or more numbers          |
|     *     |       Multiplies two or more numbers          |
|     /     |      Gives the quotient of two numbers        |
|    **     |        Raises a number to some power          |
|    //     | Gives the integral quotient of two numbers    |
|     %     |     Gives the remainder of two numbers        |
|  unary -  |              Negates a number                 |

Examples:

```python
>>> a = 45
>>> b = 6

>>> a + b  # + operator
51
>>> a - b  # - operator
39
>>> a * b  # * operator
270
>>> a / b  # / operator
7.5
>>> a ** 2  # a to the power 2
2025
>>> a // b  # // operator
7  # notice difference from /
>>> a % b  # % operator
3
>>> -a  # unary -
-45
```

While all other operators took **two** operands (`a` and `b`; `a` and `2` in the case of `**`), the unary `-` takes only one: the number to be negated. This makes all other operators except unary `-` and unary `+` (yes, it's there but of no use in most cases) binary (two) operators.

Also, take note of how `//` differs from `/`. It always gives only the integral part of `a / b`. As a result, `/` is called **true division** and `//` is called **floor division** (since it floors the result of  `/`).

You might remember that the `%` operator only works on integer values. But, in Python, you can apply it on floats as well. It won't give you an error. But, the result won't be correct or reliable:

```python
>>> a = 6.3
>>> b = 0.3
>>> a % b
5.551115123125783e-17
```

That's a very small number (5.5 x 10<sup>-17</sup>), but still not 'correct' since 6.3 is completely divisible by 0.3 (equivalent to `63/3` in mathematics) and should yield `0` as the remainder. **So, as a rule of thumb, don't use `%` with floats**.


Out of these, the `+` and `*` operators have a few more frequent use cases. Let's look at them one by one.

#### The `+` operator

The `+` operator is also used to concatenate two or more sequences (lists, tuples, strings, etc). For those of you who don't know, concatenation is the process of adding the elements of one sequence to the end of another sequence, thereby extending the latter sequence by the elements of the first. So, if I had two lists, `a = [1, 2, 3]` and `b = [4, 5, 6]`, concatenating **`b` to `a`** would result in the list, `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`. Note the terminology. I am concatenating `b` to `a` because of which, elements of `a` will appear first followed by those of `b`.

Recall what you have to do in C to achieve the same result. A new function needs to be created that will do this process for you. But, in Python, you can use the `+` operator instead. Let's look at a few examples:

```python
>>> a = [1, 2, 3]  # List
>>> b = [4, 5, 6]
>>> a + b
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

>>> a = 'Malay'  # String
>>> b = 'Agarwal'
>>> a + ' ' + b  # Adding space in between
'Malay Agarwal'

>>> a = (1, 2, 3)  # Tuple
>>> b = (4, 5, 6)
>>> a + b
(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
```

Of course, except in the case of numbers, the two operands to `+` should be of the same type. While it makes sense to say `1 + 2.3` where `1` is an integer and `2.3` is a float, it doesn't make sense to say `'Malay' + [1, 2, 3]`. Python tells you just as much:

```python
>>> a = 1  # Integer
>>> b = 2.3  # Float
>>> a + b
3.3

>>> a = 'Malay'  # String
>>> b = [1, 2, 3]  # List
>>> a + b
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "list") to str
```

#### The `*` operator

The `*` operator can be used to repeat the contents of a sequence a number of times. Let's say that you have the list, `[0]`, containing only one element. You are writing a program where you need to have a list containing 10 `0`'s. When it comes to C, you'd have to write a function which would do this for you. But in Python, you can simply use the `*` operator and write `[0] * 10`, thereby repeating the `0` in the list 10 times.

Let's look at an example:

```python
>>> a = [0]  # List
>>> b = a * 10
>>> b
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
>>> len(b)
10

>>> b = [0] * 3
>>> b
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
>>> len(b)
10
```

You can see how the `0` in the list was repeated 10 times. You can do this with strings and tuples as well.

```python
>>> a = 'M' * 3  # String
>>> a
'MMM'

>>> a = (1,) * 3
>>> a
(1, 1, 1)
```

Note: It doesn't make sense to do this in sets or dictionaries since the former only stores unique values while in the latter, for each value, the key needs to be unique. Repeating a set of elements a number of times will just be that same set of elements and so will be the case with dictionaries. 

As a result, Python gives you an error when you try to do it:

```python
>>> a = {1} * 3
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'set' and 'int'

>>> a = {1:1} * 3
a = {1:1} * 3
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'dict' and 'int'
```

You can also create nested structures with this, though that is not recommended. [Do **not** create nested lists using this](/4.0%20Variables%20and%20Operators/4.1%20Variables.md#caveats). You may safely create nested tuples though due to their immutability (think about it, why would you, though? is it really necessary?):

```python
>>> a = ((1,),) * 3
>>> a
((1,), (1,), (1,))
```

### Relational Operators

#### Overview

The relational operators in Python are tabulated as follows:

| Operator  |                                                                                    Operation                                                                                      |
|:--------: |:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:   |
|     >     |                Checks whether an entity is greater than another entity or not. `True` if left operand is greater than right operand. `False` in all other cases.                  |
|    >=     |  Checks whether an entity is greater than or equal to another entity or not. `True` if left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand. `False` in all other cases.    |
|     <     |                   Checks whether an entity is less than another entity or not. `True` if left operand is less than right operand. `False` in all other cases.                     |
|    <=     |       Checks whether an entity is less than or equal to another entity or not. `True` if left operand is less than or equal to right operand. `False` in all other cases.         |
|    ==     |                Checks whether an entity is equal to another entity or not. `True` if left entity has contents same as right entity. `False` in all other cases.                   |
|    !=     |         Checks whether an entity is not equal to another entity or not. `True` if left entity's contents differ from that of right entity. `False` in all other cases.            |
|    is     |      Checks whether two variables point to the same memory address or not. `True` if left variable has same memory address as right variable . `False` in all other cases.        |
|  is not   | Checks whether two variables point to different memory addresses or not. `True` if left variable has different memory address than right variable. `False` in all other cases.    |


You'll notice that I used the word 'entities' instead of saying 'number'. This is because all relational operators work on any Python data type. When it comes to sets though, the `<`, `<=`, `>` and `>=` operators take on different meanings, like `+` and `*` do in case of lists, strings and tuples. You have seen this different behavior when we talked about [sets](/3.0%20Data%20types/3.6%20The%20set%20data%20type.md#subset-and-superset-checking).

Let's look at a few examples:

```python
>>> a = 5
>>> b = 6

>>> a > b  # greater than
False
>>> a < b  # less than
True
>>> a >= b  # greater than or equal to
False
>>> a <= b  # less than or equal to
True
>>> a == b  # equal to
False
>>> a != b
True
```

When you compare two sequences like a list, tuple or a string, **the comparison occurs [lexicographically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicographical_order).** Lexicographical comparison refers to comparing things on the basis of how they appear on a number line or in the English alphabet. This means `1` is considered to be smaller than `2`, and `a` is considered to be smaller than `b`. 

Generally speaking, the most common comparison that happens with sequences is equality. Two sequences are considered to be equal if:

* They are of the same type
* They have equal length
* They have equal corresponding elements, all occurring in the _same_ order

This means that a list and a tuple can never be equal, two lists of unequal length can never be equal, and `[1, 2, 3]` and `[2, 1, 3]` are not equal:

```python
>>> a = [1, 2, 3]  # List and Tuple
>>> b = (1, 2, 3)
>>> a == b
False

>>> a = [1, 2]  # Unequal lengths
>>> b = [1, 2, 3]
>>> a == b
False

>>> a = [1, 2, 3]  # Same content, different order
>>> b = [2, 3, 1]
>>> a == b
>>> False

>>> a = [1, 2, 3]  # None of the conditions violated
>>> b = [1, 2, 3]
>>> a == b
True
```

In a nutshell, two sequences are equal if they look exactly the same in all aspects.

Except strings, other sequences are rarely compared using `<`, `>`, `>=` and `<=`. In case of strings, it makes sense to use these operators since you can rank the strings depending on their position in an English dictionary. For example, we know that the word `apple` appears before the word `zoo` in a dictionary. Python says the same thing:

```python
>>> a = 'apple'
>>> b = 'zoo'
>>> a < b
True
```

How can you use this fact? Say you have a list of names and you want to sort the names in alphabetical order. You can simply do this:

```python
>>> a = ['zack', 'brian', 'sarah', 'adam']
>>> a.sort()
>>> a
['adam', 'brian', 'sarah', 'zack']
```

Sets and dictionaries behave a little differently with `==`.

If you recall, sets and [dictionaries](/3.0%20Data%20types/3.5%20The%20dict%20data%20type.md#ordering-in-dictionaries) are unordered data types where the ordering does not matter. This is just a fancy way of saying that the sets, `{1, 2, 3}` and `{3, 2, 1}`, are equal and the dictionaries, `{1: 'A', 2: 'B', 3: 'C'}` and `{3: 'C', 1: 'A', 2: 'B'}`, are equal.

```python
>>> a = {1, 2, 3}
>>> b = {3, 2, 1}
>>> a == b
True

>>> a = {1: 'A', 2: 'B', 3: 'C'}
>>> b = {3: 'C', 1: 'A', 2: 'B'}
>>> a == b
True
```

> Note: While the document linked for dictionaries above says that dictionaries are ordered, it only means that dictionaries will now remember the order in which items are added to them. Therefore, when you loop over the dictionary, you'll always get the same result, with the first item you added being the first and the last item you added being the last. But, when it comes to comparisons, this 'memory' of insertion is not considered.


#### `is` vs `==`

When people start out with Python, they often confuse `is` with `==`, mainly because it looks and sounds better to say `if x is 2` than it does to say `if x == 2`. But, the two operations are fundamentally different in what they do and actually compare.

`==` compares the actual contents of two data structure or variables holding some data. It is concerned with _what_ the variables point you. On the other hand, `is` is concerned with _where_ the variables point to. In other words, `is` compares the memory addresses of two variables.

I want you think about this. The behaviors are fundamentally different. When we [talked about variables](/4.0%20Variables%20and%20Operators/4.1%20Variables.md#two-variables-with-same-value), you saw something like this:

```python
>>> a = 1
>>> b = 1
```

Since an integer is immutable, you saw that both `a` and `b` point to the same memory address which has `1` in it. On the other hand, you also saw this:

```python
>>> a = [1, 2, 3]
>>> b = [1, 2, 3]
```

In this case, since a list is mutable, you saw that `a` and `b` point to two different lists which happen to have the same content (`1`, `2` and `3`). This means that `a` and `b` have different memory addresses associated with them and calling `id()` on them will return two different integers.

```python
>>> id(a), id(b)
(140380636673160, 140380636673928)
```

Therefore, we have two situations **given that two variables have the same contents**:

* They can be pointing to the same memory address (as in the case of integers)
* They can be pointing to different memory addresses (as in the case of lists)

While `==` is concerned with the contents, `is` is concerned with the memory addresses. 

Therefore, in the case of mutable data types, using `==` and `is` will always return the same result, since the memory address isn't really very important:

```python
>>> a = 1
>>> b = 1
>>> a == b
True
>>> a is b
True

>>> a = 2
>>> b = 3
>>> a == b
False
>>> a is b
False
```

In case of mutable data types, on the other hand, using `==` and `is` will only give the same result if the variables have been created using [`a = b`](/4.0%20Variables%20and%20Operators/4.1%20Variables.md#one-variable-equal-to-another) or when the variables are unequal:

```python
>>> a = [1, 2, 3]
>>> b = a
>>> a == b
True
>>> a is b
True

>>> a = [1, 2, 3]
>>> b = [1, 2, 3]
>>> a == b
True
>>> a is b
False

>>> a = [1, 2, 3]
>>> b = [4, 5, 6]
>>> a == b
False
>>> a is b
False
```

**In a nutshell, use `==` when you want to compare the contents of two variables and use `is` when you want to compare their memory addresses.**

### Logical Operators

#### Overview

The three logical operators in Python are tabulated as follows:

| Operator  |                                                                       Operation                                                                           |
|:--------: |:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:    |
|    and    |     Checks whether both the operands are `True` or not. Returns the left operand if it is `False`. In all other cases, returns the right operand.         |
|    or     | Checks whether either one of the operands are `True` or not. Returns the left operand if it is `True`. In all other cases, returns the right operand.     |
|    not    |                                       Negates the operand. Returns `True` if operand is `False` and vice-versa.                                           |

In Python, instead of using `&&`, `||` and `!`, we use t=he words `and`, `or` and `not`. Also, we know that traditionally, the logical operators always evaluate to true or false. But, when it comes to Python, these operators can actually return any valid Python data type.

Before we get started with these operators though, we should talk about a separate concept in Python as it as an integral part of logical operators.

#### Meet my Friends - Truthy and Falsy

When learning C, you must remember these trick questions, asking you the output of the program:

```c
int main(void)
{
    if (0)
        printf("Tricked!\n");
    else
        printf("Not so simple!\n");

    return 0;
}
```

The answer? `Not so simple!`. This is because C considers zero to be false and all non-zero numbers to be true. As a result, the `if`-statement evaluates to false and the `else`-block is executed.

Similarly, Python has a few entities other than the values `True` and `False` that it considers to be true and false. **Those entities that are considered to be true are called _truthy_ and those which are considered to be false are called _falsy_.** The key word is considered. These entities are not _actually_ true or false but are only considered to be so, just as `0` is considered to be false in C.

The truthy entities are non-zero numbers and non-empty sequences. This means any number that is not zero is considered to be `True` and any sequence (lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets, strings) with _at least_ one element in it is considered to be `True`. 

For example, the number `1` and the list, `[1, 2, 3]`, when written in an `if`-statement in the same fashion as `0` up above, will evaluate to `True` and result in the `if`-block being executed.

The falsy entities are the number zero and empty sequences. This means that `0` is considered to be `False` and any sequence with exactly 0 elements in it is considered to be `False`. 

For example, the list, `[]`, the string, `''` and the tuple, `()`, all will evaluate to `False` when written as the condition in an `if`-statement, similar to `0` up above.

You can use this fact to check whether a sequence is empty or not directly, without having to calculate its length, but you will see that when you learn about `if`-statements.

Now that that's out of the way, let's discuss each of the operators.

#### The `and` operator

As mentioned above, logical operators can return any valid Python data type, including `True` and `False`. We write `and` as `x and y`. It _returns_ `x` if `x` is `False` and returns `y` in all other cases.

What do I mean by returns `x` and returns `y`? Let's say we have the following two variables:

```python
>>> x = []
>>> y = [1, 2, 3]
```

When you use them with `and`, you'll see that the result is not `True` or `False`, but something else:

```python
>>> x and y
[]
```
As can be seen, the result is the empty list, `[]`, that is the value of `x`. This is because an empty sequence is considered to be falsy and here, `x` is the empty list, `[]`. As a result, `and` returns the value of `x`. Let's reverse the variables and see what happens:

```python
>>> y and x
[]
```

We get the same empty list (`and` is commutative, after all), but this time, you should take note that the empty list corresponds to the second operand. Since `y` is the non-empty list, `[1, 2, 3]`, it is considered to be `True` (truthy) and the second operand is returned, which is `x`, the empty list.

Now, you may ask, why do I get `True` or `False` in the following cases?

```python
>>> x = 1
>>> y = 2
>>> x > 0 and y == 2
True

>>> x != 1 and y != 2
False
```

The answer is quite simple. In the first operation, the operands are `x > 0` and `y == 2`. These are comparisons and hence, always evaluate to `True` or `False`. As a result, this is actually equivalent to `True and True`. Since the first operand is `True`, the second operand is returned, thereby giving you `True`.

In the second case, the operation is equivalent to `False and False`. Since the first operand is `False`, it is returned.

**Again, `x and y` returns `x` if `x` is `False` and returns `y` in all other cases.** Since all Python data types have a 'truthyness' and a 'falsyness' associated with them, `and` can return any valid Python data type.

Think about this. What is the nature of `and`? For a true result, it requires that both `x` and `y` be true. So, if `x` is `False`, it makes no sense to evaluate the expression any further. Simply returning `x` will do. But, in case `x` is true, the result of the expression depends on `y`. If `y` is true, the expression will evaluate to true and if `y` is false, it will evaluate to false. Therefore, simply returning `y` is sufficient.

This is even evident from the truth table of `and`:

| x   | y   |           x and y             |
|:-:  |:-:  |:---------------------------:  |
| 1   | 0   | 0 (which is the value of y)   |
| 1   | 1   | 1 (which is the value of y)   |
| 0   | 1   | 0 (which is the value of x)   |
| 0   | 0   | 0 (which is the value of x)   |

As can be seen, in cases where `x` is true, the result depends on `y` and in cases where `x` is false, the result depends on `x` only. Python simply follows this logic.

Some more examples:

```python
>>> x = 1
>>> sign_x = x >= 0 and "Positive" # Getting sign of x
>>> sign_x  # Of course, an if would do this better
'Positive'

>>> x = 1
>>> y = 2
>>> y != 0 and x / y  # Avoiding division by 0
0.5
```

#### The `or` operator

If you look at the truth table of `or`, you will get the following:

| x   | y   |           x or y              |
|:-:  |:-:  |:---------------------------:  |
| 1   | 0   | 1 (which is the value of x)   |
| 1   | 1   | 1 (which is the value of x)   |
| 0   | 1   | 1 (which is the value of y)   |
| 0   | 0   | 0 (which is the value of y)   |

From this, you see that in cases where `x` is true, we get the value of `x` and in cases where `x` is false, the result depends on the value of `y`. Just like `and`, Python follows this logic for its `or` operator.

Given `x or y`, Python returns `x` if `x` is `True` and returns `y` in all other cases. Again, think about this. What is nature of `or`? For a true result, it requires either one of its operands to be true. So, if `x` is true, it makes no sense to go ahead and evaluate the rest of the expression. The expression's value has already been determined. If `x` is false, the expression's result depends on the value of `y`. If `y` is false, the expression evaluated to false and if it is true, the expression evaluates to true.

Let's look at a few examples:

```python
>>> x = []
>>> y = [1, 2, 3]
>>> x or y
[1, 2, 3]
```

Here, since `x` is an empty list, it is considered to be `False` and `y` is returned, which is `[1, 2, 3]`. When we reverse the variables:

```python
>>> y or x
[1, 2, 3]
```

We get the same result (commutativity), but this time `[1, 2, 3]` is associated with the first operand. Since `y` is a populated list, it is considered to be `True` and returned.

More examples:

```python
>>> x = 1
>>> y = 2
>>> x == 1 or y > 3
True

>>> x > 0 or "Negative"
True

>>> x < 0 or "Positive"
"Positive"
```

In both `x and y` and `x or y`, you'll notice that evaluation stops mid-way once the value of the operation has been determined. In the case of `and`, it stops if `x` is `False` and in case of `or`, it stops if `x` is `True`. **This mid-way stoppage of evaluation is called short-circuiting, where the rest of the 'circuit' is just ignored if the 'circuit's' end result has already been determined by previous parts of the 'circuit'.** Short-circuiting is available in many programming languages.

#### The `not` operator

The not operator is simple and just negates the result of an expression:

```python
>>> x = 1
>>> not x > 0
False

>>> not x == 1
False

>>> not x > 1
True
```

It is more commonly used to determine whether a sequence is empty or not:

```python
>>> x = []
>>> not x
True
```

Here, since `x` is an empty list, it is considered to be `False`. Doing `not x` makes the result `True`, thereby giving you an effective way to determine whether a sequence is empty or not. As a rule of thumb, if `not x` is `True`, it means the sequence is empty.

### Assignment Operators

These operators are straightforward and do not need much explanation (yet):

```python
>>> x = 2
>>> x += 2
>>> x
4
>>> x -= 2
>>> x
2
>>> x *= 2
>>> x
4
>>> x /= 2
>>> x
2
>>> x %= 4
>>> x
2
>>> x **= 2
>>> x
4
```

But, don't use them in tandem with immutable sequences which have mutable objects in them such as list inside a tuple:

```python
>>> x = ([1, 2, 3], 1, 'Malay')
>>> x[0] += [4, 5, 6]
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment
>>> x
([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], 1, 'Malay')
```
You got an error, but what you wanted did happen. Think about this. `x[0]` refers to the list in the tuple and you're extending it using `+=`. The `+=` modifies the list in-place and then tries to assign the same list to the tuple. But, a tuple being immutable doesn't let you do that, hence the error. The list still appears as modified because it is the same list that was inside the tuple in the beginning. This isn't a bug. It's a consequence of language design and actually the correct behavior considering all things. We will talk about this much later.

## Conclusion

Well, that's all about operators!
