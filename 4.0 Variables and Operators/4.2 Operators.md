## Operators in Python

Operators are a key component for any programming language as they allow you to manipulate and mutate data in different, standardized ways. For example, we all know that the `+` operator is expected to add two or more numbers, and in certain other programming languages, to concatenate two or more sequences (strings, arrays, etc).

Python is no exception to this. It has its own standard set of operators that you can use with different kinds of data.

Just like most programming languages out there, Python has five different types of operators. They are:

* **Arithmetic Operators** - These _primarily_ deal with numbers, allowing us to add, subtract, multiply, divide and perform other operations on them. I say primarily as Python, being a high-level language, allows you to perform other operations with these operators when it comes to certain types of data. Examples include `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `**`, etc.

* **Relational Operators** - These operators are used to evaluate or more precisely, check the relation between two or more expressions (those statements which evaluate to some result) in terms of their values. For example, the `>` operator is used to evaluate the relationship of one expression being greater than the other. Other examples are `>=`, `<`, `>=`, `!=`, `==`, `is`, `is not`, etc.

* **Logical Operators** - These are operators that are used to connect one or more expressions so that they form one single logical unit. For example, you can connect two expressions using the `and` or `or` operators. The only other operator is `not`.

* **Bitwise Operators** - These are operators that work on single bits of data. We all know that deep inside, in the memory of the computer, everything that we type in Python is converted to binary `1`'s and `0`'s. Bitwise operators work on this representation of data. For example, the value of 3 in binary is `11`. A bitwise operator would manipulate each of the two bits (`1` and `1`) in this, thereby producing a new binary number and hence, a new decimal number. Examples include `>>`, `<<`, `&`, `|`, `^`, etc.

* **Assignment Operators** - These are operators that are used to give values to variables. They are very familiar to anyone with background in a programming language. Examples include `=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, etc.



While bitwise operators are indeed interesting, we won't be covering them since they fit more well with a computer science session than with a Python session. Assignment operators won't be discussed extensively since all of them are pretty familiar to you.

Let's start with the first category of operators, that is arithmetic operators.


### Arithmetic Operators

The arithmetic operators in Python are tabulated as follows:

| Operator  |                Primary Work                   |
|:--------: |:------------------------------------------:   |
|     +     |          Adds two or more numbers             |
|     -     |        Subtracts two or more numbers          |
|     *     |       Multiplies two or more numbers          |
|     /     |      Gives the quotient of two numbers        |
|    **     |        Raises a number to some power          |
|    //     | Gives the integral quotient of two numbers    |
|     %     |     Gives the remainder of two numbers        |
|  unary -  |              Negates a number                 |

Examples:

```python
>>> a = 45
>>> b = 6

>>> a + b  # + operator
51
>>> a - b  # - operator
39
>>> a * b  # * operator
270
>>> a / b  # / operator
7.5
>>> a ** 2  # a to the power 2
2025
>>> a // b  # // operator
7  # notice difference from /
>>> a % b  # % operator
3
>>> -a  # unary -
-45
```

While all other operators took **two** operands (`a` and `b`; `a` and `2` in the case of `**`), the unary `-` takes only one: the number to be negated. This makes all other operators except unary `-` and unary `+` (yes, it's there but of no use in most cases) binary (two) operators.

Also, take note of how `//` differs from `/`. It always gives only the integral part of `a / b`. As a result, `/` is called **true division** and `//` is called **floor division** (since it floors the result of  `/`).

You might remember that the `%` operator only works on integer values. But, in Python, you can apply it on floats as well. It won't give you an error. But, the result won't be correct or reliable:

```python
>>> a = 6.3
>>> b = 0.3
>>> a % b
5.551115123125783e-17
```

That's a very small number (5.5 x 10<sup>-17</sup>), but still not 'correct' since 6.3 is completely divisible by 0.3 (equivalent to `63/3` in mathematics) and should yield `0` as the remainder. **So, as a rule of thumb, don't use `%` with floats**.


Out of these, the `+` and `*` operators have a few more frequent use cases. Let's look at them one by one.

#### The `+` operator

The `+` operator is also used to concatenate two or more sequences (lists, tuples, strings, etc). For those of you who don't know, concatenation is the process of adding the elements of one sequence to the end of another sequence, thereby extending the latter sequence by the elements of the first. So, if I had two lists, `a = [1, 2, 3]` and `b = [4, 5, 6]`, concatenating **`b` to `a`** would result in the list, `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`. Note the terminology. I am concatenating `b` to `a` because of which, elements of `a` will appear first followed by those of `b`.

Recall what you have to do in C to achieve the same result. A new function needs to be created that will do this process for you. But, in Python, you can use the `+` operator instead. Let's look at a few examples:

```python
>>> a = [1, 2, 3]  # List
>>> b = [4, 5, 6]
>>> a + b
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

>>> a = 'Malay'  # String
>>> b = 'Agarwal'
>>> a + ' ' + b  # Adding space in between
'Malay Agarwal'

>>> a = (1, 2, 3)  # Tuple
>>> b = (4, 5, 6)
>>> a + b
(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
```

Of course, except in the case of numbers, the two operands to `+` should be of the same type. While it makes sense to say `1 + 2.3` where `1` is an integer and `2.3` is a float, it doesn't make sense to say `'Malay' + [1, 2, 3]`. Python tells you just as much:

```python
>>> a = 1  # Integer
>>> b = 2.3  # Float
>>> a + b
3.3

>>> a = 'Malay'  # String
>>> b = [1, 2, 3]  # List
>>> a + b
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "list") to str
```

#### The `*` operator

The `*` operator can be used to repeat the contents of a sequence a number of times. Let's say that you have the list, `[0]`, containing only one element. You are writing a program where you need to have a list containing 10 `0`'s. When it comes to C, you'd have to write a function which would do this for you. But in Python, you can simply use the `*` operator and write `[0] * 10`, thereby repeating the `0` in the list 10 times.

Let's look at an example:

```python
>>> a = [0]  # List
>>> b = a * 10
>>> b
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
>>> len(b)
10

>>> b = [0] * 3
>>> b
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
>>> len(b)
10
```

You can see how the `0` in the list was repeated 10 times. You can do this with strings and tuples as well.

```python
>>> a = 'M' * 3  # String
>>> a
'MMM'

>>> a = (1,) * 3
>>> a
(1, 1, 1)
```

Note: It doesn't make sense to do this in sets or dictionaries since the former only stores unique values while in the latter, for each value, the key needs to be unique. Repeating a set of elements a number of times will just be that same set of elements and so will be the case with dictionaries. 

As a result, Python gives you an error when you try to do it:

```python
>>> a = {1} * 3
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'set' and 'int'

>>> a = {1:1} * 3
a = {1:1} * 3
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'dict' and 'int'
```

You can also create nested structures with this, though that is not recommended. [Do **not** create nested lists using this](). You may safely create nested tuples though due to their immutability (think about it, why would you, though? is it really necessary?):

```python
>>> a = ((1,),) * 3
>>> a
((1,), (1,), (1,))
```

### Relational Operators

The relational operators in Python are tabulated as follows:

| Operator  |                                                                                    Operation                                                                                      |
|:--------: |:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:   |
|     >     |                Checks whether an entity is greater than another entity or not. `True` if left operand is greater than right operand. `False` in all other cases.                  |
|    >=     |  Checks whether an entity is greater than or equal to another entity or not. `True` if left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand. `False` in all other cases.    |
|     <     |                   Checks whether an entity is less than another entity or not. `True` if left operand is less than right operand. `False` in all other cases.                     |
|    <=     |       Checks whether an entity is less than or equal to another entity or not. `True` if left operand is less than or equal to right operand. `False` in all other cases.         |
|    ==     |                Checks whether an entity is equal to another entity or not. `True` if left entity has contents same as right entity. `False` in all other cases.                   |
|    !=     |         Checks whether an entity is not equal to another entity or not. `True` if left entity's contents differ from that of right entity. `False` in all other cases.            |
|    is     |      Checks whether two variables point to the same memory address or not. `True` if left variable has same memory address as right variable . `False` in all other cases.        |
|  is not   | Checks whether two variables point to different memory addresses or not. `True` if left variable has different memory address than right variable. `False` in all other cases.    |


You'll notice that I used the word 'entities' instead of saying 'number'. This is because all relational operators work on any Python data type. When it comes to sets though, the `<`, `<=`, `>` and `>=` operators take on different meanings, like `+` and `*` do in case of lists, strings and tuples. You have seen this different behavior when we talked about [sets](../3.0%20Data%20types/3.6%20The%20set%20data%20type.md#Subset%20and%20Superset%20Checking).
