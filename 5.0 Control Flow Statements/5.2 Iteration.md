## Iteration in Python

### Introduction

Iteration is a basic functionality available in all programming languages. Python is no exception to this. Before I describe the various ways in which you can do iteration, it is important to know what iteration is.


Iteration is the process of repeating one or more lines of code a certain number of times, so that the lines of code are reevaluated with each repetition.

The above definition is in no way a standard definition, but it gives you the basic idea.

Let's say there is a party at your house. You plan on inviting 20 of your closest friends. As food, you want to serve them some sandwiches, containing mayonnaise, cucumber and tomato with small pinches of salt and pepper. What steps will you follow? Something along these lines:

```text
1. Take two slices of bread
2. Spread mayonnaise on both slices
3. Cut up the cucumber and tomato
4. Place them on any one slice
5. Sprinkle salt and pepper on the slice
6. Place the other slice on top of this slice
7. Give a nice squeeze to the sandwich so that it is firm
8. Repeat steps 1 through 7 till remaining sandwiches are ready
```

Pay attention to the last step in this list. It asks you to repeat the steps 1 through 7. This is because the steps 1 through 7 only result in one sandwich, but you need 20 sandwiches in total (let's assume that you won't eat any sandwiches). Repeating the steps 20 times will give you the 20 sandwiches.


Now, let's build a similar list for some operation more computationally driven. Let's say I want to list out all squares from 1 to 100. This can be done as follows:

```text
1. Initialize num = 1
2. Calculate square = num ** 2
3. Print value of square
4. Change num to num + 1
5. Repeat steps 2 through 4 till num = 100
```

This is a very natural set of steps and very much alike the steps described for making the sandwiches (albeit having more computation). If you repeat steps 2 through 4, you'll get the squares of all numbers from 1 to 100.

This particular flow of steps can be visualized as follows:

This is the essential idea behind iteration: repetition of the same steps a number of times. Iteration is also referred to as looping, since you're going to the same point as in a loop.

Now, that's all well and good. For you and me, if I tell you to "repeat" something, you'll understand that I want you to do that thing again. But, how do you tell a programming language that you want it to repeat something? In other words, what is the synonym for the word "repeat" in Python? Well, there are two synonyms: `for`-loop and `while`-loop.


When you write some lines of code in a `for`- or `while`-loop, Python will understand that you want it to repeat those lines of code some number of times.

Let's see how you can write each of these loops.

### The `while`-loop

#### Overview

The `while`-loop is a commonly found loop in most programming languages. It repeats a number of steps till some condition remains `True`. Once the condition becomes `False`, the loop ends and whatever that comes after the loop starts executing.

Let's say that you are having another party. This time, you do not know how many guests are going to be there, but you want to serve sandwiches to all of them. What do you do? You keep making sandwiches until all of the guests have a sandwich. If you look at the list up above, you'll keep repeating steps 1 through 7 till all guests have a sandwich.

A `while`-loop is like this. You do not know how many iterations there are going to be, but you do know that it is going to keep iterating till some condition becomes false. In the sandwich-example, you do not know how many sandwiches you'll end up making, but you do know that the process will keep going till all guests have a sandwich.

#### The Syntax

To write a `while`-loop in Python, you use the keyword `while`, followed by a `condition` and a `:` (colon):

```python
while condition:
    # body
```

[As for `if`-statements](/5.0%20Control%20Flow%20Statements/5.1%20The%20if%20Statement.md#the-syntax), the indentation becomes important. Anything that is indented by one level after the `while` line is part of the loop and will repeat till `condition` becomes `False`.

A natural question arises. What can `condition` be? It can be any expression that evaluates to `True` or `False`, including entities that are considered truthy or falsy. For example, `x < 5` is a valid condition to be used in a `while`-loop.

As a rule of thumb, a condition that can be used in an `if`-statement can also be used in a `while`-loop.

To understand it better, let's look at a few examples.

#### Examples

* **Printing squares of numbers between 1 and 100**:

```python
num = 1
while num <= 100:
    print(num ** 2)
    num += 1
```
Here, `num` is first initialized to `1`. Then, we write the `while`-loop with the condition that it should run only till `num` is either less than or exactly equal to `100`. For each iteration of the loop, Python is to print the square and increment `num`'s value by 1. When the value of `num` becomes `101`, Python checks the condition in the `while`-loop, evaluating `101 <= 100`. Since this is `False`, the loop stops.

Take note of the final statement in the loop. It increments the value of `num` by 1 in each iteration. This is essential to making the loop stop. Let's assume that there is no increment. Then, for each iteration, the value of `num` will always be `1` and the condition, `num <= 100` will always evaluate to `True` since `1 <= 100`. This would create an _infinite_ loop which never stops running. In most cases, you don't want an infinite loop and should avoid them.

Therefore, generally speaking, when you write some condition in a `while`-loop, it should become `False` through manipulation of the variables involved in it by the loop's body. If the values of the variables involved in the condition do not chanage in any iteration of the loop (or do not change correctly), the loop will become infinite.

Sometimes, though, you might want to write an infinite loop deliberately. Python provides you with a neat way of doing that.

* **Making a loop run an infinite number of times**:

```python
while True:
    # do something
```

This is simple and intuitive. Since `True` is `True` in each iteration of the loop, the loop becomes infinite. Later, we'll use this method to generate infinitely long series of numbers, so keep it in mind.

In certain cases, we might want to keep taking input from the user till they decide to stop supplying an input. This can be achieved using a `while`-loop.

* **Taking input from user till they decide to stop**:

```python
repeat = True

while repeat:
    num = input("Enter a number: ")
    print("You entered ", num)
    
    prompt = input("Would you like to enter another number? (Y/N) ")
    if prompt in ('N', 'n'):
        repeat = False
```
We first set a variable `repeat` to `True`. Then, this variable is used as the condition in the `while`-loop. In the first iteration, since the value of `repeat` is `True`, the loop is executed. In the final statements of the loop, it asks the user to decide whether they want to input another number or not. The user can enter `Y` or `y` indicating `yes`, and `N` or `n` indicating `no`. If the user enters `N` or `n`, the value of repeat is changed to `False`. When this happens, in the next iteration, when the condition is checked again, it will evaluate to `False` and the loop won't execute. Hence, no more input will be taken.

This is a common use case of `while`-loops. In languages such as `C` or `C++`, this would have been done by a `do-while` loop. This loop runs at least once, irrespective of its condition being `True` or `False` in the first iteration. But, Python does not have those and `while`-loops are used instead.

Once we're done with `for`-loops, we'll look at a few more examples of `while`-loops.
