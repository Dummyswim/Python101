## Iteration in Python

### Introduction

Iteration is a basic functionality available in all programming languages. Python is no exception to this. Before I describe the various ways in which you can do iteration, it is important to know what iteration is.


Iteration is the process of repeating one or more lines of code a certain number of times, so that the lines of code are reevaluated with each repetition.

The above definition is in no way a standard definition, but it gives you the basic idea.

Let's say there is a party at your house. You plan on inviting 20 of your closest friends. As food, you want to serve them some sandwiches, containing mayonnaise, cucumber and tomato with small pinches of salt and pepper. What steps will you follow? Something along these lines:

```text
1. Take two slices of bread
2. Spread mayonnaise on both slices
3. Cut up the cucumber and tomato
4. Place them on any one slice
5. Sprinkle salt and pepper on the slice
6. Place the other slice on top of this slice
7. Give a nice squeeze to the sandwich so that it is firm
8. Repeat steps 1 through 7 till remaining sandwiches are ready
```

Pay attention to the last step in this list. It asks you to repeat the steps 1 through 7. This is because the steps 1 through 7 only result in one sandwich, but you need 20 sandwiches in total (let's assume that you won't eat any sandwiches). Repeating the steps 20 times will give you the 20 sandwiches.


Now, let's build a similar list for some operation more computationally driven. Let's say I want to list out all squares from 1 to 100. This can be done as follows:

```text
1. Initialize num = 1
2. Calculate square = num ** 2
3. Print value of square
4. Change num to num + 1
5. Repeat steps 2 through 4 till num = 100
```

This is a very natural set of steps and very much alike the steps described for making the sandwiches (albeit having more computation). If you repeat steps 2 through 4, you'll get the squares of all numbers from 1 to 100.

This particular flow of steps can be visualized as follows:
